# Where have I been?

Hello, sorry for being inactive for a while, with the pandemic and everything going on, it's been difficult to manage everything. 
As such my website, development, and general productivity has been largely ignored. 

That said, some things have changed:

<ul>
<li>I've been promoted to Junior Developer</li>
<li>I'm still working through my level 4 software development apprenticeship</li>
<li>With the help of a coworker, an issue I had with Habit Rabbit is fixed, and so development can continue when I have the headspace</li>
</ul>

In addition:

I have changed the way my cv displays on the site now, this has fixed some styling issues (I hope, sadly I can't test this locally on my mobile, but I will look into that).
This does however have the drawbacks of a pdf border around it that I'm not keen on, and that I'll have to redeploy the wesbite when I want to update it, as it's no longer pulled directly from my Google Docs. 

With this in mind, my CV is currently out of date, as it doesn't have my promotion on it. I will update this in the future, but it's not currently a priority for me.

I hope everyone has a great festive season, and hopefully the new year will bring more free time to develop.

title:  "Progress on Habit Tracking App"
---

# I've started making an application

I've named it Habit Rabbit, using the logo featured in my last post. 
So far it's a basic todo-list type app which I have set up using Expo. 
It's written using React-redux, and will make use of SQLite for locally storing the habits the user wants to track. 
In the future I will look into adding in cloud storage for syncing progress across devices. 

## Issues
One issue I've come across is that earlier in the year I bought a new PC, great specs for gaming. 
Sadly with an AMD processor, which refuses to run a mobile emulator. So all testing is being done on my physical device!
Not ideal, but it could be worse.

# Added my CV at long last!

You can view my cv by clicking on the briefcase icon on the navigation bar.

Please excuse some of the styling, I've embedded it from Google Docs so I can edit it remotely and not have to update the code on here, 
However it's not displaying the preview quite as intended. 
If you email me, I will be happy to send over a pdf copy, with the correct styling.

## Now that My website is up and running

I've been planning to make a mobile application to track good habits, which I'll start working on in the next couple of hours/days. 
All I have so far is a name and logo: Habit Rabbit!

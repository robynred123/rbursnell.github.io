  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
    My name is Robyn Bursnell, <br>
    I am currently based in Leeds, UK and working as an apprentice software developer for ASDA. <br>
    In my role I predominantly work with React Native, Redux, and Javascript, and am working on improving my skills to become a full-stack developer. <br>
    <br>
    I have a degree in Archaeology from the University of Chester, and an interest in a wide range of subjects in and out of technology. I can be known as a serial hobby starter, but not a serial hobby finisher. <br>
    I like to play games, digital and traditional, and hope to make some of my own in the future. <br>

  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
    My name is Robyn Bursnell, 
    I am currently based in Leeds, UK and working as an apprentice software developer for ASDA. 
    In my role I predominantly work with React Native, Redux, and Javascript, and am working on improving my skills to become a full-stack developer. 

    I have a degree in Archaeology from the University of Chester, and an interest in a wide range of subjects in and out of Technology. 
    I like to play games, digital and traditional, and hope to make some of my own in the future.
